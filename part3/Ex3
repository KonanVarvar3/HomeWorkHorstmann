Supertype for String,  Scanner,  ImageOutputStream is Object.

Any class can be a superclass for a subclass.
A class can not be its own superclass.

You can create a regular class that does not inherit, but in fact all classes inherit
from the Object class. All other classes, even the ones we add to our project,
are implicitly derived from the Object class. Any interface type is a subtype of Object.
